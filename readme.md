This is a project to remake the google homepage while looking at the inspect 
elements as little as possible. During the project I used the inspect elements
to get some font sizes, font style, color, and some icons. Other than that
I came up with the rest of the design myself which resulted in some differences
between this webpage and the original. All links go to the google homepage.
